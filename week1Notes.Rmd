power = prob of discoverying a real signal if it is there

- power is typically set at 80%
- calculations re based on made up assumptions.  guess in advance how big the signal will be
- do a power calc before your experiment, low powered studies don't replicate
- power is a function of the sample size, the diff between the two groups, and the variance

- power ex1: n = 10 for each group, effect is 5, and sigma is 10  (i.e 18%)

`power.t.test(n=10, delta=5, sd=10)`

- power = 80%; effect = 5 pop SD = 10 (i.e. 64 in each group)

`power.t.test(power=.8, delta=5, sd=10)`  

- power = 80%; effect = 5 pop SD = 10 & one-sided (i.e. 51 in each group)

` power.t.test(power=.8, delta=5, sd=10, alternative="one.sided") ` 

question:  how to you relate effect size to a genomics experiment.  What does "5" mean??  what would this be, difference in two groups
